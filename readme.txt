1. Upload retweeters.zip to '/wp-content/plugins/' directory and unzip it.
1. Activate the Plugin from "Manage Plugins" window
1. Retweeters Widget: From the "Widgets" Window drag and drop the "Retweeters" widget onto the desired sidebar. This widget is not yet active. Go to Step 4.
1. Activate Features: From the Wordpress Plugins side-menu bar, click on the "Retweeters" Plugin link. Once there, choose the required options and click on "Update Options" button. If you are using the plugin for the first time and LinksAlpha.com is indexing your blog for the first time, content in the "Retweeters" sidebar widget will show up in 2-3 minutes. "Tweet" content for each blog post might take 10-15 minutes to show up.
1. Stats: To make your life easier, you can now easily tell if your blog is getting indexed by LinksAlpha.com. From the "Retweeters" plugin page, "Stats" column on the right hand side of the page should show your recent blog posts indexed by LinksAlpha.com.
